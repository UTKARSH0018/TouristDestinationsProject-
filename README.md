# TouristDestinationsProject-

The TouristDestinationsProject is an interactive web application designed to help users explore and plan their travels to various locations across India. The project is developed using React.js for the frontend logic and dynamic user experience, and HTML and CSS for the structure and styling of the application.

# Key Features:

Welcoming Interface:

Upon entering the application, users are greeted with a welcoming text: "Plan With Utkarsh!", setting an inviting tone for the travel planning experience.

# Destination Cards:

The main feature of the application consists of 7 cards, each representing a different travel destination in India.

# Each card includes:

Destination Name: Clearly displaying the name of the place.
Travel Price: Providing the estimated cost required to travel to that destination.
Description Paragraph: Offering a brief overview of what the destination has to offer, highlighting key attractions and unique aspects.
Not Interested Button: Allowing users to remove destinations they are not interested in from the view.

# Dynamic Interaction:

Users can click the Not Interested button to remove any destination card from the UI. This helps in filtering out places that do not appeal to the user.
If all destination cards are removed, a Refresh Button appears. This button, when clicked, reloads the main page and brings back all 7 destination cards, allowing users to start the exploration process again.

# Technologies Used:

React.js: For creating a dynamic and responsive user interface, managing the state of the application, and handling user interactions.
HTML: For structuring the content of the web application.
CSS: For styling the application, making it visually appealing and user-friendly.

The TouristDestinationsProject provides an engaging and straightforward way for users to plan their travels by offering detailed information and interactive features, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
